///
/// Counted once and remembered. Three tests below ask for it, and the walk
/// reads every Swift file under `Tests/` and every Rust file under `crates/` —
/// 146 files. Warm that is 16 ms and doing it three times costs nothing worth
/// naming; **cold it is 5 798 ms**, measured on the first read after a
/// container restart, or about 40 ms a file on storage that is not local. That
/// single figure sits above bun's 5 000 ms default, which is how this test
/// timed out once for a reason that had nothing to do with what it checks.
///
/// Memoising takes three cold walks down to one. It does not make the first
/// one fast, and no amount of caching would: the bytes have to arrive. The
/// deliberate non-fix is the timeout — raising it to thirty seconds would end
/// the spurious red and would also stop this test from ever noticing a genuine
/// tenfold slowdown, which is the same blindness as a guard that cannot fail.
/// A rare red with a known cause, written down here, is the better trade.
